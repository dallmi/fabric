## 🔑 Key Business Questions Answered

1. **"Why do we need deduplication?"**
   - See: Word doc Section 5, Excel Sheet 2 STEP 2
   - Answer: Without it, you overcount by 20-50% (engaged employees visit multiple articles)

2. **"What % of our company engaged with our content?"**
   - See: Excel file, any sheet's "% of Company" column (yellow highlight)
   - Example: News & Events reached 0.004% of company (5 out of 130K employees)

3. **"How does filtering work?"**
   - See: Excel file, compare Sheets 2-4
   - Answer: Combined filters show INTERSECTION (employees matching ALL criteria)

4. **"When does most engagement happen?"**
   - See: Excel Sheet 5, all scenarios show most growth in first 7-14 days
   - Answer: Little new engagement after day 14

5. **"How fast will queries run?"**
   - See: Word doc Section 7 "Performance Expectations"
   - Answer: < 1 second for most queries (thanks to 130K fixed user base)

6. **"What are realistic engagement targets?"**
   - See: Word doc Section 5 "Why Employee Count Matters"
   - Answer: Industry standard for intranets: 5-15% monthly active users
