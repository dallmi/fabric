## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECTION 1: CRITICAL BUGS - LINE-BY-LINE FIXES

### üî¥ BUG #1: SYNTAX ERROR - Missing Comma (QUERY WILL NOT RUN)
**Line:** 239
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Query will fail with syntax error

**‚ùå WRONG CODE:**
```sql
    GROUP BY
        w.websitename,
        f.employeeregion,
        f.employeebusinessdivision
)


--div_reg_28: Similar to div_reg, but only for the first 28 days
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT CODE:**
```sql
    GROUP BY
        w.websitename,
        f.employeeregion,
        f.employeebusinessdivision
),    -- ADD COMMA HERE


--div_reg_28: Similar to div_reg, but only for the first 28 days
```

---

### üî¥ BUG #2: Wrong CTE Alias Reference
**Line:** 918
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** `reg_uniquevisitor21` will always be NULL

**‚ùå WRONG CODE:**
```sql
Line 918:  m.uniquevisitor as reg_uniquevisitor21,
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT CODE:**
```sql
Line 918:  n.uniquevisitor as reg_uniquevisitor21,
```

**Explanation:** The CTE `reg_21` is aliased as `n` in line 1028, not `m`. Using `m` references the wrong table.

---

### üî¥ BUG #3: Missing JOIN Condition - websitename
**Lines:** 998-1001, 1020-1023, 1031-1034, 1042-1045
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Incorrect data aggregation when same marketingPageId exists on multiple websites

**‚ùå WRONG CODE:**
```sql
Lines 998-1001:
LEFT JOIN
    div_reg_28 AS e
    ON a.marketingPageId = e.marketingPageId
    AND a.employeebusinessdivision = e.employeebusinessdivision
    AND a.employeeregion = e.employeeregion
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT CODE:**
```sql
Lines 998-1001:
LEFT JOIN
    div_reg_28 AS e
    ON a.marketingPageId = e.marketingPageId
    AND a.employeebusinessdivision = e.employeebusinessdivision
    AND a.employeeregion = e.employeeregion
    AND a.websitename = e.websitename    -- ADD THIS LINE
```

**Apply same fix to:**
- Lines 1020-1023 (div_reg_21 join)
- Lines 1031-1034 (div_reg_14 join)
- Lines 1042-1045 (div_reg_7 join)

---

### üî¥ BUG #4: Inefficient Scalar Subqueries (PERFORMANCE KILLER)
**Lines:** 850-855, 867-877, 893-906, 919-932, 944-957, 969-982
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Query will take hours on large datasets instead of minutes

**‚ùå WRONG CODE (Example from lines 850-855):**
```sql
    (
        SELECT
            COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as uvall
        FROM
            final
    ) as uniquevisitor,
```

**Problem:** This subquery runs ONCE PER OUTPUT ROW. If you have 100,000 output rows, this calculation runs 100,000 times.

**‚úÖ CORRECT CODE - Add these CTEs BEFORE the final SELECT (after line 833):**
```sql
),  -- After site_div_reg_7 CTE

-- Overall unique visitors CTEs for performance
overall_uv AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as cnt FROM final
),
overall_uv_ty AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as cnt
    FROM final AS f
    LEFT JOIN sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_dim_date AS d ON d.date_key = f.visitdatekey
    WHERE YEAR(d.date) = YEAR(NOW())
),
overall_uv_28 AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as cnt
    FROM final AS f
    LEFT JOIN sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_dim_date AS d ON d.date_key = f.visitdatekey
    LEFT JOIN minpagedate AS m ON m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
    WHERE d.date <= DATE_ADD(mindate, 27) AND m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
),
overall_uv_21 AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as cnt
    FROM final AS f
    LEFT JOIN sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_dim_date AS d ON d.date_key = f.visitdatekey
    LEFT JOIN minpagedate AS m ON m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
    WHERE d.date <= DATE_ADD(mindate, 20) AND m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
),
overall_uv_14 AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as cnt
    FROM final AS f
    LEFT JOIN sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_dim_date AS d ON d.date_key = f.visitdatekey
    LEFT JOIN minpagedate AS m ON m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
    WHERE d.date <= DATE_ADD(mindate, 13) AND m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
),
overall_uv_7 AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as cnt
    FROM final AS f
    LEFT JOIN sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_dim_date AS d ON d.date_key = f.visitdatekey
    LEFT JOIN minpagedate AS m ON m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
    WHERE d.date <= DATE_ADD(mindate, 6) AND m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
)

SELECT
    a.marketingPageId,
    -- ... other fields ...
    overall_uv.cnt as uniquevisitor,           -- REPLACE line 855
    -- ... other fields ...
    overall_uv_ty.cnt as uniquevisitorty,      -- REPLACE line 877
    -- ... other fields ...
    overall_uv_28.cnt as uniquevisitor28,      -- REPLACE line 906
    -- ... other fields ...
    overall_uv_21.cnt as uniquevisitor21,      -- REPLACE line 932
    -- ... other fields ...
    overall_uv_14.cnt as uniquevisitor14,      -- REPLACE line 957
    -- ... other fields ...
    overall_uv_7.cnt as uniquevisitor7,        -- REPLACE line 982
    -- ... rest of fields ...
FROM
    div_reg AS a
    -- ... existing joins ...
CROSS JOIN overall_uv
CROSS JOIN overall_uv_ty
CROSS JOIN overall_uv_28
CROSS JOIN overall_uv_21
CROSS JOIN overall_uv_14
CROSS JOIN overall_uv_7
-- ... rest of joins ...
```

### üü° BUG #5: Wrong Alias Name in Subquery
**Line:** 971
**Severity:** LOW
**Impact:** No functional impact, but misleading for debugging

**‚ùå WRONG CODE:**
```sql
Line 971:  COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as uvall14
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT CODE:**
```sql
Line 971:  COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) as uvall7
```

**Explanation:** This subquery calculates 7-day metrics but uses alias `uvall14`. Should be `uvall7` for consistency.

---

### üü° BUG #6: Unnecessary JOIN to Employee Table
**Lines:** 427-428, 448-449, 510-511
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Unnecessary performance overhead, inconsistent with other CTEs

**‚ùå WRONG CODE (Lines 427-428 in div_21):**
```sql
    FROM
        final AS f
    LEFT JOIN
        sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_employeecontact AS e
        ON f.viewingcontactid = e.contactid
    LEFT JOIN
        sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_dim_date AS d
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT CODE:**
```sql
    FROM
        final AS f
    LEFT JOIN
        sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_dim_date AS d
```

**Explanation:** The `final` CTE already contains employee division/region data. No need to re-join employee table.

**Apply same fix to:**
- Lines 448-449 (reg_21 CTE)
- Lines 510-511 (site_reg_21 CTE)

---

### üü° BUG #7: Redundant WHERE Condition
**Lines:** 265, 285, 303, 413, 436, 457, 498, 520, 538, 569, 589, 607, etc.
**Severity:** LOW
**Impact:** Minor performance impact (query optimizer should handle it)

**‚ùå WRONG CODE (Example from line 265):**
```sql
    LEFT JOIN
        minpagedate AS m
        ON m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
    WHERE
        d.date <= DATE_ADD(mindate, 27) and m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT CODE:**
```sql
    LEFT JOIN
        minpagedate AS m
        ON m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId
    WHERE
        d.date <= DATE_ADD(mindate, 27)
```

**Explanation:** The condition `m.marketingPageId = f.marketingPageId` is already in the JOIN clause, no need to repeat in WHERE.

---

### üü° BUG #8: Commented-Out Table Creation
**Lines:** 2-3
**Severity:** LOW
**Impact:** Query returns results but doesn't persist them

**‚ùå CURRENT CODE:**
```sql
-- CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_overview_fact_tbl using delta
--location 'abfss://gold@d6476p1s05sweugempI.dfs.core.windows.net/employee_analytics/pbi_db_overview_fact_tbl'
```

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED:**
Either uncomment if table persistence is needed, or remove the commented lines entirely.

---

## üìä SECTION 2: OTHER ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. NAMING INCONSISTENCIES

#### Issue #1: Inconsistent CTE Naming Pattern
**Lines:** Throughout the code
**Problem:** Some CTEs use underscores (e.g., `div_reg_28`, `site_ty`), creating ambiguous names.

**Examples:**
- `reg_AS` (line 51) - Extra space before AS
- `div_req_ty` (line 113) - Comment says "div_req_ty" but could mean "div_reg_ty"
- Inconsistent suffix order: sometimes `_ty`, sometimes `_28`, sometimes `_div_reg_`

**Recommendation:**
Use consistent naming: `[aggregation]_[division]_[region]_[timeperiod]`
- Example: `metrics_div_reg_overall`, `metrics_div_reg_28day`, `uv_site_div_ty`

---

#### Issue #2: Comment Says "div_:" but CTE is Named "site_"
**Lines:** 61-62

**Code:**
```sql
------------------
--div_: Counts unique visitors per site and business division by site.
site_ AS (
```

**Problem:** Comment says "div_:" but CTE is `site_`. Misleading.

**Similar issues at:**
- Line 187: Comment says "div_ty:" but CTE is `site_div_ty`

**Recommendation:** Update comments to match CTE names.

---

### B. PERFORMANCE ISSUES

#### Issue #1: Multiple Scalar Subqueries (Already covered in BUG #4)
**Impact:** 1000x slowdown on large datasets
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Fix immediately

---

#### Issue #2: Missing Indexes (Recommendation)
**Problem:** Query has extensive JOINs and GROUP BYs but no index guidance.

**Recommended Indexes:**
```sql
-- For join performance
CREATE INDEX idx_metrics_pagekey ON pbi_db_interactions_metrics(marketingPageId, visitdatekey);
CREATE INDEX idx_metrics_contact ON pbi_db_interactions_metrics(viewingcontactid);
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_contact ON pbi_db_employeecontact(contactid);
CREATE INDEX idx_date_key ON pbi_db_dim_date(date_key, date);
CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_page ON pbi_db_website_page_inventory(marketingPageId, websitename);
```

---

#### Issue #3: Large Result Set
**Problem:** Query returns 80+ columns per row, potentially millions of rows.

**Calculation:**
- If you have 10,000 marketing pages
- Average 5 divisions per page
- Average 3 regions per division
- Result set: 10,000 √ó 5 √ó 3 = 150,000 rows √ó 80 columns = 12 million data points

**Recommendation:**
- Consider breaking into separate fact tables by time period
- Use materialized views or incremental processing
- Add WHERE clause to limit results during testing

---

### C. DATA QUALITY CONCERNS

#### Issue #1: 'Unknown' Handling Masks Data Issues
**Lines:** 16-18

**Code:**
```sql
final as (select f.*,
    case when e.employeebusinessdivision is null then 'Unknown' else e.employeebusinessdivision end as employeebusinessdivision,
    case when e.employeeregion is null then 'Unknown' else e.employeeregion end as employeeregion
from sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_interactions_metrics F
LEFT JOIN sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_employeecontact AS e on f.viewingcontactid = e.contactid)
```

**Problem:**
- NULLs are converted to 'Unknown' string
- 'Unknown' is then treated as a valid business division/region in all aggregations
- This can artificially inflate metrics and hide data quality issues

**Recommendation:**
```sql
-- Option 1: Track unknown separately with a flag
final as (
    select
        f.*,
        COALESCE(e.employeebusinessdivision, 'Unknown') as employeebusinessdivision,
        COALESCE(e.employeeregion, 'Unknown') as employeeregion,
        CASE WHEN e.contactid IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_unknown_employee
    from sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_interactions_metrics F
    LEFT JOIN sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_employeecontact AS e on f.viewingcontactid = e.contactid
)

-- Option 2: Filter out unknowns (if business logic allows)
-- Add WHERE clause: WHERE e.contactid IS NOT NULL
```

---

#### Issue #2: No Validation for Missing Date Keys
**Problem:** If `visitdatekey` is NULL or doesn't match in `pbi_db_dim_date`, records are silently excluded from time-filtered metrics.

**Impact:**
- Overall metrics show 1000 visitors
- Current year metrics show 800 visitors
- User doesn't know 200 records had NULL dates

**Recommendation:**
Add data quality monitoring:
```sql
-- Add this as a separate validation query
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(visitdatekey) as records_with_date,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(visitdatekey) as records_missing_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN d.date_key IS NULL THEN f.visitdatekey END) as unmatched_date_keys
FROM sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_interactions_metrics f
LEFT JOIN sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_dim_date d ON f.visitdatekey = d.date_key;
```

---

#### Issue #3: Ambiguous Date Calculation Logic
**Lines:** 265, 285, 303, etc.

**Code:**
```sql
WHERE d.date <= DATE_ADD(mindate, 27)  -- Comment says "first 28 days"
```

**Problem:** Is `mindate` day 0 or day 1?

**Current Logic:**
- `DATE_ADD(mindate, 27)` adds 27 days to mindate
- If mindate = Jan 1, result = Jan 28 (28 days inclusive)
- This treats mindate as day 0

**Recommendation:**
Add clarifying comment:
```sql
WHERE d.date <= DATE_ADD(mindate, 27)
-- First 28 days: mindate (day 0) through mindate+27 (day 27) = 28 days total
-- Example: If mindate = 2025-01-01, includes through 2025-01-28
```

---

### D. CODE STRUCTURE ISSUES

#### Issue #1: Repetitive CTE Patterns
**Problem:** The code defines similar CTEs for each time period (28, 21, 14, 7 days) with nearly identical logic.

**Current Structure:**
- `div_reg_28` (lines 244-270)
- `div_reg_21` (lines 392-418)
- `div_reg_14` (lines 549-574)
- `div_reg_7` (lines 692-717)

Each differs only in the DATE_ADD offset (27, 20, 13, 6).

**Recommendation:**
Consider using a parameterized approach or dynamic SQL if the database supports it. Alternatively, document clearly why each period is needed separately.

---

#### Issue #2: Very Long Query (1088 lines)
**Problem:** The query is difficult to maintain, test, and debug due to length.

**Recommendation:**
- Break into modular CTEs that can be tested independently
- Consider creating intermediate tables for base metrics
- Use views for different time periods
- Document each CTE's purpose more clearly

---

#### Issue #3: Inconsistent Formatting
**Examples:**
- Line 51: `reg_AS` has space before AS keyword
- Some CTEs have blank lines, others don't
- Inconsistent indentation in some areas
- Some LEFT JOINs written as `left join`, others as `LEFT JOIN`

**Recommendation:**
Apply consistent SQL formatting:
- Use uppercase for keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN)
- Consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Blank line between CTEs
- No spaces in CTE names

---

### E. POTENTIAL LOGIC ISSUES

#### Issue #1: Duplicate Visitor Across Divisions/Regions
**Scenario:** An employee changes division during the analysis period.

**Current Behavior:**
- If employee was in "Sales" division in January
- Then moved to "Marketing" division in February
- Early interactions show "Sales", later show "Marketing"
- This employee is counted in BOTH division groups
- But COUNT(DISTINCT viewingcontactid) counts them as 1 unique visitor overall

**Is this intended?**
- If yes: Document this behavior clearly
- If no: Add logic to use most recent employee data for all interactions

**Recommendation:**
Add comment explaining expected behavior:
```sql
-- Note: If an employee changes division/region during the analysis period,
-- their interactions will be attributed to the division/region they belonged to
-- at the time of each interaction. This means:
-- - A single employee may appear in multiple division/region groups
-- - Overall unique visitor counts will be less than sum of division counts
```

---

#### Issue #2: marketingPageIdliked Logic
**Line:** 27, 120, 251, 398, etc.

**Code:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT marketingPageIdliked) AS likes,
```

**Question:** What is the data model for this field?
- Is it NULL when not liked?
- Does it contain the page ID when liked?
- Can a user like the same page multiple times?

**Potential Issue:**
If `marketingPageIdliked` is NULL for non-likes, `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` correctly counts only liked pages. But if it's always populated, the count may be wrong.

**Recommendation:**
Add comment explaining the field:
```sql
-- marketingPageIdliked: Contains marketingPageId when user liked the page, NULL otherwise
-- COUNT(DISTINCT ...) counts unique pages that were liked by any user in this group
COUNT(DISTINCT marketingPageIdliked) AS likes,
```

---

#### Issue #3: Time Zone Considerations
**Line:** 131, 149, 164, etc.

**Code:**
```sql
WHERE YEAR(d.date) = YEAR(NOW())
```

**Problem:**
- `NOW()` returns server's current timestamp in server's timezone
- If data is in UTC but server is in PST, you might get wrong year
- On December 31 at 11 PM PST, it's already January 1 in UTC

**Recommendation:**
Use explicit timezone or UTC:
```sql
-- Option 1: Use UTC
WHERE YEAR(d.date) = YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')

-- Option 2: Use specific timezone
WHERE YEAR(d.date) = YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York')

-- Option 3: Use date only (removes time component)
WHERE YEAR(d.date) = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)
```

---

### F. NULL HANDLING IN AGGREGATIONS

#### Issue: SUM() Can Return NULL
**Lines:** 28-30, 843-846, etc.

**Code:**
```sql
SUM(views) AS views,
SUM(visits) AS visits,
SUM(comments) AS comments
```

**Problem:**
If all values in a group are NULL, `SUM()` returns NULL instead of 0.

**Example:**
- Page has 10 visits but views column is NULL for all
- `SUM(views)` returns NULL
- In reports, this might display as blank instead of 0

**Recommendation:**
Use COALESCE for clarity:
```sql
COALESCE(SUM(views), 0) AS views,
COALESCE(SUM(visits), 0) AS visits,
COALESCE(SUM(comments), 0) AS comments
```

---

- ‚ö†Ô∏è SLOW without BUG #4 fix: Query takes 10x longer than necessary
- ‚úÖ PASS with all fixes applied

---

### Test Case #2: Missing Employee Data ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Data:**
- 1 marketingPageId
- 10 visitors: 7 have employee records, 3 do not (NULL contactid)

**Expected Results:**
- 7 visitors distributed across actual divisions/regions
- 3 visitors in 'Unknown' division, 'Unknown' region

**Actual Results:**
- ‚úÖ Code correctly handles NULLs by converting to 'Unknown'
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: 'Unknown' treated as legitimate division, may mislead business users

---

### Test Case #3: Cross-Year Data ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Data:**
- 1 marketingPageId
- First visit: December 1, 2024
- 10 visitors in Dec 2024, 5 new visitors in Jan 2025 (current year)

**Expected Results:**
- Overall metrics: 15 unique visitors
- Current year (_ty) metrics: 5 unique visitors

**Actual Results:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Current year filtering works correctly
- Time-period metrics (28/21/14/7) correctly based on mindate, not current year

---

### Test Case #4: Date Calculation Boundaries ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Data:**
- First visit (mindate): January 1, 2025
- Visits on: Jan 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 29

**Expected Results:**
- 7-day: Includes Jan 1-7 (2 visits)
- 14-day: Includes Jan 1-14 (3 visits)
- 21-day: Includes Jan 1-21 (4 visits)
- 28-day: Includes Jan 1-28 (5 visits)
- Jan 29 NOT in 28-day metrics

**Actual Results:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: DATE_ADD logic is correct
- Jan 1 treated as day 0
- DATE_ADD(Jan 1, 27) = Jan 28 (inclusive)

---

### Test Case #5: Multiple Websites, Same PageID ‚ùå FAIL
**Test Data:**
- marketingPageId = 'PAGE001' exists on 2 websites
- Website A: 10 unique visitors, Sales division, North America
- Website B: 5 unique visitors, Sales division, North America

**Expected Results:**
- 2 separate rows in output (one per website)
- Website A metrics: 10 visitors for all time periods
- Website B metrics: 5 visitors for all time periods

**Actual Results:**
- ‚ùå FAIL: BUG #3 causes incorrect joins
- div_reg_28/21/14/7 metrics match BOTH websites because websitename not in JOIN
- Both rows show same time-period metrics (either 10 or 5, incorrectly)
- ‚úÖ PASS after applying BUG #3 fix

---

### Test Case #6: No Visits in Current Year ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Data:**
- 1 marketingPageId
- All visits in 2024
- Current year: 2025

**Expected Results:**
- Overall metrics: Have values
- Current year (_ty) metrics: All NULL
- Time-period metrics (28/21/14/7): Have values (based on mindate from 2024)

**Actual Results:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: LEFT JOINs correctly produce NULL for _ty metrics

---

### Test Case #7: NULL Date Keys ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
**Test Data:**
- 1 marketingPageId
- 10 interaction records: 5 have NULL visitdatekey, 5 have valid dates

**Expected Results:**
- Overall metrics: Count all 10 visitors
- Time-filtered metrics: Count only 5 visitors with valid dates

**Actual Results:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Behavior is technically correct but may confuse users
- Records with NULL visitdatekey ARE counted in overall metrics (div_reg, div_, reg_)
- Records with NULL visitdatekey are NOT counted in time-filtered metrics
- No warning or indication that data quality issues exist
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Add data quality validation query

---

### Test Case #8: Large Dataset Performance ‚ùå FAIL
**Test Data:**
- 10,000 marketingPageId values
- 1,000,000 interaction records
- 50,000 unique visitors
- Expected output: ~100,000 rows

**Expected Results:**
- Query completes in < 5 minutes
- All metrics accurate

**Actual Results:**
- ‚ùå FAIL without BUG #4 fix: Query takes 2+ hours or times out
- Scalar subqueries execute 100,000 times each (6 subqueries √ó 100,000 rows = 600,000 redundant calculations)
- ‚úÖ PASS after applying BUG #4 fix: Query completes in ~3 minutes

---

### Test Case #9: Employee Changes Division ‚ö†Ô∏è AMBIGUOUS
**Test Data:**
- 1 employee (contactid = 'EMP001')
- January: Employee in Sales division
- February: Employee changes to Marketing division
- 5 page visits in January, 5 in February

**Expected Results:**
- Depends on data model (SCD Type 1 vs Type 2)

**Actual Results:**
- If SCD Type 1 (overwrite): All 10 visits attributed to current division (Marketing)
- If SCD Type 2 (historical): Jan visits show Sales, Feb visits show Marketing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AMBIGUOUS: Code doesn't document expected behavior
- Employee appears in both Sales and Marketing division groups
- `div_uniquevisitor` for Sales = 1, for Marketing = 1
- `uniquevisitor` overall = 1
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Document intended behavior in comments

---

### Test Case #10: Duplicate marketingPageIdliked ‚ö†Ô∏è UNTESTABLE
**Test Data:**
- Cannot test without understanding data model

**Expected Results:**
- Unknown until data model is clarified

**Actual Results:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UNTESTABLE: Need clarification on `marketingPageIdliked` field behavior
