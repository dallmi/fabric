-- SharePoint Analytics - Marketing Page Overview Fact Table
-- =====================================================================================
-- Description: Pre-aggregated metrics for marketing page interactions across multiple
--              dimensions (division, region, website) and time periods (all-time,
--              current year, first 28/21/14/7 days)
--
-- Purpose:     Improve Power BI performance by calculating unique visitors and metrics
--              at the database layer instead of in-memory aggregations
--
-- Target:      sharepoint_gold.pbi_db_overview_fact_tbl
--
-- Version:     2.0 - FIXED & OPTIMIZED
-- Date:        2025-10-07
-- Changes:     - Fixed all critical bugs from code review
--              - Optimized scalar subqueries to CTEs for performance
--              - Added comprehensive documentation
--              - Improved NULL handling and data quality
