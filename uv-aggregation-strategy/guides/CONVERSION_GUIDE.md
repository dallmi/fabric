# Document Conversion Guide

## Document Status
✅ **Ready for .docx conversion**

The file `uv_aggregation_strategy_proposal.md` has been optimized for clean conversion to Microsoft Word format.

## What Was Changed

All ASCII box-drawing characters and complex Unicode symbols have been replaced with:
- **Standard markdown tables** - Will render as proper Word tables
- **Bold headings** - For section emphasis
- **Bullet lists** - Instead of decorated boxes
- **Emoji symbols** - Only common ones (✓, ✗, ⚡, ⌛, ⬇️) that render in most systems
