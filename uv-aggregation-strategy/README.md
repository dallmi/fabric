## üîë Key Concepts

### Unique Reach (Deduplicated)
Count each employee **once** even if they visited multiple articles during launch periods.

**Example:**
- Employee visits 3 articles ‚Üí Counted as 1 unique employee
- Shows true audience size: "5 employees (0.004% of company)"

### Total Interactions (With Duplicates)
Count each visit separately.

**Example:**
- Employee visits 3 articles ‚Üí Counted as 3 interactions
- Shows engagement volume: "6 total visits"

### Why Deduplication Matters
- **Without:** 6 visits ‚Üí Incorrectly report "6 visitors"
- **With:** 5 unique employees ‚Üí Correct count (one visited 2 articles)
- **Impact:** Prevents 20-50% overcount

## üìà Business Value

1. **Accurate Metrics:** No double-counting of engaged employees
2. **% of Company:** Executive-friendly KPIs (e.g., "2.4% of company engaged")
3. **Division Comparison:** "Marketing 64% vs Sales 45%" engagement
4. **Realistic Targets:** Industry standard 5-15% monthly active for intranets
5. **Fast Queries:** Sub-second performance (thanks to 130K fixed user base)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review** Excel file with 2-3 business stakeholders
2. **Present** to executive sponsor
3. **Discuss** open questions (Word doc Section 10)
4. **Approve** Hybrid Approach recommendation
